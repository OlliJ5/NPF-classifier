## Initial Plan

- [x] Build some simple binary classification without anything special to get a baseline. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes
- [ ] Accuracy estimation for these baseline models. Cross-validation n shit
- [ ] better data exploration, feature selection and other preprocessing, better model selection
- [x] Binary to Multi-label

## Week 2

* Solve logistic regression warning: lbfgs failed to converge
	- [x] Normalize data?
	- [x] Feature selection? - simple select k-best added, does not affect score...

- [ ] Accuracy estimations
- [ ] Cross-validation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation
- [x] p-estimator for class2 (predicted class - event probabilities)
