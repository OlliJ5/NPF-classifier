## Initial Plan

* Build some simple binary classification without anything special to get a baseline. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes
* Accuracy estimation for these baseline models. Cross-validation n shit
* better data exploration, feature selection and other preprocessing, better model selection
* Binary to Multi-label
