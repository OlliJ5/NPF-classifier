## Initial Plan

- [x] Build some simple binary classification without anything special to get a baseline. Logistic regression and Naive Bayes
- [ ] Accuracy estimation for these baseline models. Cross-validation n shit
- [ ] better data exploration, feature selection and other preprocessing, better model selection
- [ ] Binary to Multi-label

## Week 2

* Solve logistic regression warning: lbfgs failed to converge
	- [x] Normalize data?
	- [ ] Feature selection?

- [ ] Accuracy estimations
- [ ] Cross-validation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation
